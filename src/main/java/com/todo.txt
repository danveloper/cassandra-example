TODO:

- improved scheduling of rollers
    - a roller for minutes, is now allowed to overtake the roller of seconds.
    - the scheduling mechanism is not distributed
    - the scheduling mechanism is not able to deal with a restart

- aggregate function velocity

- failover; when a machine fails a different machines should take over the rollup.

- the column-key of a rollup data should be an exact second, minute hour etc. Not the the moment the rollup was done.

- embedded cassandra
http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Embedding

- aggregate from multiple machines, same cluster, for the same 'distributed object'.

- tables per environment?
    - an additional set of tables could be created. Where

- a keyspace per customer?

DONE

- type of the value column for the measurement is changed to long; needed for counter

- the scheduling mechanism currently only deals with a single customer

- pass the customer family to the repository functions

- add function where the column families for a customer are made

- customer isolation.

- find the sensors for a given customer within a give time period.

- get rid of the datapointTemplate

- expiring old data:
  http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/whats-new-cassandra-07-expiring-columns

- correctly implement the names

- when there are many sensors within a slice, currently it is all done on a single thread.
    - a task per rowid could solve the problem. The question is how to figure out which rowids are there.

- the rollup thread always compact for a specific rowid; but it should compact for all rowids

- aggregate function
    - average
    - maximum
    - minimum

- currently all entries for slice a pulled and memory and then they are processed, this could lead to a OOME problem. There is real need for it since one
can iterate over it.

- compacting; currently the measurements are in miliseconds.
    - compact to seconds
    - compact to minutes
    - compact to hours
    - compact to days
    - compact to weeks
    - compact to months

- pulled creation of keyspace out of the repository; multiple repositories can now share the same keyspace.

- new columnfamilies are now added on the fly.

- the search results are not returned sorted.

- there is a problem with the initial timestamp

- multi user

- the source of the measurement needs to be added

- currently all measurements are in a single keyspace; should there be a keyspace per user for isolation?

Under water it adds a prefix transparently; so the same solution I'm using.
