TODO:

- compression of active members, servers


QUESTIONS:

- how to figure out which metrics are available
    - in total
    - for a machine
  or should the metrics be static? So apply a filter on the incoming metrics.

- how to figure out which distributed data-structures are available
   this could be calculated based on the raw data.

DONE

- company and env need to be added to the row key
    - the should be removed from the column key

- need a list of active clusters

- need a list of active members within a cluster (this could be done on the raw metrics)
