TODO:

- compression of active members, servers

- aggregators items are never removed.. so a potential OOME.

- on restart, there is no history for the aggregators

- a long history is potentially maintained (and looked for) in the collector; perhaps do something with granularity? So instead
of having a linear granularity, you have e.g. an exponential one. Currently the granularity is constant at 1 second. But e.g.
after 30 seconds it becomes 5 seconds.. with an hour it becomes a minute etc etc.

- aggregate on members
    - this is problematic, since each member could talk to a different mancenter machine.
    So all the information is not available on a single machine

- aggregate on id's
    - this is possible since every all data from a single member wil be available as on a single mancenter machine

- check how 'latency' fits in.
    - latency is an absolute number, but useless raw. So e.g. you take the difference in latency in a period
      you take the difference in e.g. read count and you can do delta-latency/delta-reads.

- behavior when no measurements appear  for existing aggregator

- clean up the placement of the measurement; currently it is race;and all contention on a single point.
    - could be done with a single linked list and a cas, this way the item is placed and will be processed
     or someone else has placed it or the list has been cleaned; and both cases it needs to be retried.

- currently all datapoint repositories have equal frequency of writing, but datapoints with higher rollingtime,
don't need to write as frequent. This will also reduce the number of writes.

QUESTIONS:

- the timestamp on a datapoint, is that of the management center, not that of the machine. Could this be an issue.

- how to figure out which metrics are available
    - in total
    - for a machine
  or should the metrics be static? So apply a filter on the incoming metrics.

- how to figure out which distributed data-structures are available
   this could be calculated based on the raw data.

DONE

- no parallelisation

- velocity

- values are now double.

- company and env need to be added to the row key
    - the should be removed from the column key

- need a list of active clusters

- need a list of active members within a cluster (this could be done on the raw metrics)
