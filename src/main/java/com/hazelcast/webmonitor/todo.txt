TODO:

- compression of active members, servers

- no parallelisation

- aggregators items are never removed.. so a potential OOME.

- on restart, there is no history for the aggregators

- aggregate on members

- aggregate on id's

- velocity

- check how 'latency' fits in.

QUESTIONS:

- how to figure out which metrics are available
    - in total
    - for a machine
  or should the metrics be static? So apply a filter on the incoming metrics.

- how to figure out which distributed data-structures are available
   this could be calculated based on the raw data.

DONE

- values are now double.

- company and env need to be added to the row key
    - the should be removed from the column key

- need a list of active clusters

- need a list of active members within a cluster (this could be done on the raw metrics)
