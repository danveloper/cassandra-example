TODO:

- when a timeseries is aggregated, there is only information available about the time period and not about the previous
period. This is problematic if there are only 1 datapoint. It also is problematic for the first datapoint.

- need a list of active clusters

QUESTIONS:

- can a value store a composite instead of a primitive.

- use the data point technique with tags.

- do you want to have a chain of column families for every 'function' e.g.
    avg-1-second, avg-5-second,avg-30-second
  of do you want a:
    1-second, 5-second, 30-second

- how to figure out which metrics are available
    - in total
    - for a machine
  or should the metrics be static? So apply a filter on the incoming metrics.

- how to figure out which distributed data-structures are available
   this could be calculated based on the raw data.

DONE

- need a list of active members within a cluster (this could be done on the raw metrics)
